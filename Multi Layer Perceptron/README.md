Implementing a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with stochastic gradient descent to classify optical-digit data.  
Model trained on "optdigits train.txt" data, number of hidden units of the neural network are tuned  
using "opt-digits valid.txt" data, and testing prediction performance is done using "optdig-its test.txt" data.  

Part A finds the best number of hidden units in the hidden layer using the train data.  
Part B combines train and validation data. PCA (2 and 3 principal components) is applied  
to values obtained from hidden layer and corresponding 2-D and 3-D data is plots are created.  
Part C computes the values of hidden units on the test set and creates projection plots.
