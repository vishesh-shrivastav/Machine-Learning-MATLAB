Implementing a kernel perceptron using a polynomial kernel. Training done on non-linearly separable data.  
Two class data created first, then combined and used for training and validation.  
The SVM is then run on the data in digits49_train.txt and digits49_test.txt (which have digits 4 and 9) and digits79_train.txt and digits79_test.txt (which have digits 7 and 9).
