Classification using Bayesian learning with prior and posterior probabilities.

First, calculate maximum likelihood estimation on the training set, "SPECT train.txt". Then, using learned Bernoulli distributions and
the given prior function, classify the samples in the validation set using these values for sigma: (-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).   Then, use the best prior to classify test data and report the error rate.
